# Wilson discord bot

Basic bot used for discord servers. I haven't made the bot public so instead I've released the source code on GitHub.
Contributions are fine as long as they aren't intentially stupid request. make sure to remove files you do not want in the repository efore committing.

## Brainfuck Interpreter
Wilson bot contains a simple brainfuck interpreter.
The interpreter contains multiple flags which allows the play to see the full affect of code.
I am also interested in building my own language the bot could compute on it's own.
